# Integration of Automated Calendar Event Generation for Daycare Services

# Idea Overview
The proposal aims to enhance daycare service websites by integrating an automated calendar event generation feature. This feature will allow parents to easily import their children's daycare schedules into their personal calendars (such as Outlook or Google Calendar) with a single click. By leveraging existing schedule data in the daycare's database, the system can generate an iCalendar (.ics) file, which can be downloaded and imported into any standard calendar application.

# Working Principles
Data Extraction: Utilize the daycare's existing database to extract children's schedules, including dates, start times, end times, and any special notes (e.g., 'Poissa' for days off).
Event Formatting: Convert the extracted schedule data into a standardized iCalendar format.
File Generation: Generate an iCalendar (.ics) file containing all the relevant events.
Download Link: Provide a link on the daycare service website where parents can download the .ics file.
Calendar Integration: Allow parents to import the .ics file into their personal calendar applications, ensuring they have up-to-date schedules for their children.

# Implementation Suggestion
Database Query: Develop a backend service that queries the daycareâ€™s database to fetch schedule data for each child.
ICS File Creation: Use server-side scripting (e.g., Python, PHP, Node.js) to format the fetched data into an iCalendar (.ics) file.
User Interface: Add a user-friendly interface on the daycare service website, where parents can select their child's name and generate/download the corresponding .ics file.
Automation: Consider automating the generation and emailing of .ics files to parents on a regular basis (e.g., weekly).

By integrating this feature, daycare service providers can significantly improve parental convenience, reduce scheduling errors, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
